    position:absolute means that element moves out of the
    flow of document.

    To understand this, if a div container has no height mentioned 
    (so div will take the default height which is height 
    of content inside it), and an 'h1' element as the only 
    content inside the div, and if we use position:absolute 
    (meaning the h1 will be treated as outside the div)
    then in this case height of content will become zero, 
    and therefore height of div which takes height of content
    by default will also be zero. So on screen all you'll see for the div
    is just the border, that too if the div has a border defined;
    if not, then it will appear as blank on screen

    When you use top,bottom,right,left, it moves with respect
    to the entire page, as opposed to position:relative
    where element moves with respect to its original position

    One exception to this behaviour of position:absolute is when it
    has a relatively-positioned parent. In that case, the element
    will not move with respect to the entire page, but with 
    respect to its parent.

    /* 
    This is how we center an element horizontally and vertically.
    Make its parent position relative,make the element's 
    own position absolute. That is, now the element will move 
    with respect to its parent. Now give a height and width 
    to the element, make its top, bottom, right, left 
    all equal to zero, then set margin:auto
    Element will be centered. 

    This is called "absolute + margin:auto" method

    There's a second method to center elements which is called

    make parent relative
    make child absolute, 

    then execute for child:

    top:50%; 
    left:50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
