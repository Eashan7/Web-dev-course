    <!-- To demonstrate that if you want to make multiple div's exactly overlap each other,
    make their position absolute. This way they leave the document flow and get positioned 
    at the same place. Now give them same width and height to exactly overlap. This can be useful 
    if you want to create multiple divs (holding different background images) in a common overlapping 
    space in your website and based on the button that is selected, you want to have that respective 
    image displayed in that common space. 
    
    The logic will be that you create multiple divs and make them 
    exactly overlap, then add background images in each of those overlapping divs and turn their opacitty 
    zero. Now if button1 is selected, you turn on the opacity of the image1 to 1 such that image1 is displayed
    in the common space. Similarly, if button2 is selected, image2 will be displayed in the common space. -->
