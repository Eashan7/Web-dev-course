    <!-- 
        
    To demonstrate that background-image does not need position:fixed
    to be visible on screen. The only thing it requires is a well-defined height and width.
    If height is declared in %, parent should have explicit height defined
    like height:100vh, not 'min-height'. Cause children cannot derive from parent's
    height if its min-height. (to test this, change height of body to 'height:100vh'
    You'll see the background image appear.) If however you want to keep min-height of parent
    and use % height in child, then for that use 'position fixed'.

    This div(.image) if position:fixed is not there, will occupy its normal position 
    which will not overlap with other elements. So if you want the div (.image - that 
    contains the background image) to overlap with all other elements and span 
    the entire webpage, as a background image rightly should, then you need to 
    set its position:fixed. Position:absolute will also make the background-image
    overlap, but then there'll be two limitations : 

    1.) If that div (.image) has a relatively positioned parent, it will
    take position according to the parent and not according to document flow
    which might not fill the entire webpage.

    2.) Will not be fixed with scrolling. To achieve this, we need to position it relative
    to viewport and this is only possible with position:fixed. 
    
    *NOTE*: viewport and document body are two different things.
    Viewport is the screen size
    Document body is the webpage -->
